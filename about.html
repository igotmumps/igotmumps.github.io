<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>Hi!  I’m <a href="http://google.com/+MichaelZacharias1">Michael Zacharias</a> - Mumps Programmer.  I work out of my home in Langley, British Columbia, Canada (I’m Canadian eh!).  I contract out my skills as a Mumps programmer like a gun for hire!  At any given time, there may be one or more of: two kids; two cats; or 1 wife in my office with me. So if I seem distracted, I am.</p>

<p><strong>This blog, and its contents and opinions are strictly my own</strong>.</p>

<p>Growing up, I wouldn’t say that I was into computers much.  I was interested in them, but laziness usually got the best of me.  After high-school, I ultimately discovered the need for higher education and rekindled my passion for computer programming and technology.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a>.  I first learned to program in Pascal, C/C++, Perl and later Java.  I am not old enough to know Fortran or Cobol, but I have experienced Scheme/Lisp, and can remember DOS, Windows 3.1 and Visual Basic.  After University, I got a job working with this strange thing called Mumps, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I consider myself a fairly experienced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS">Mumps</a> programmer.  I’ve been at it for over a decade working mostly in the banking vertical but also with medical and lab systems.  Most of my work has been with the <a href="http://fis-gtm.com">FIS Greystone Mumps</a> flavor of Mumps but I have played around with <a href="http://www.intersystems.com/our-products/cache/cache-overview/">Cache</a> too.  I am pretty passionate about this technology and love working with it!</p>



<h2 id="why-am-i-blogging">Why am I blogging?</h2>

<p>I heard it said once that the best way to really learn something is to teach it.  That’s the main reason for starting this blog.  With it, I hope to teach anyone reading it more about Mumps, and also to learn more about it myself.  Plus it gives me a way to keep track of what I may be working on over time.  My idea is to research how to do things in, with and about Mumps; then document them here.  I fully anticipate this to be a two way conversation so email or comments are welcome.  No spam though please!</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be a professional hockey player (what Canadian kid doesn’t right!).  I still play to this day, though I am getting slower at an exponentially increasing rate.  I run marathons, and half-marathons. I even ran a <a href="https://toughmudder.com/">Tough Mudder</a>. On most days, between the hours of 9:00am and 10:00am PST you can find me working out in my home gym.  As you can probably tell, I am a fitness nut! I like to <a href="http://allrecipes.com/cook/11820606/">cook</a>, which explains the need to work out all the time.  I am also big into <a href="http://untappd.com/user/MichaelZacharias">beer</a>.</p>
